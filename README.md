# Kyle's Bots

The splash page for my Discord bot projects. The only real point of these bots is to have small projects to work from start to finish rather quickly, what can I say it's cathartic (just INTJ things?). This splash page is built when my portfolio is deployed on my digital ocean app platform. The bots themselves are all served from a single droplet managing the different bot processes with pm2. All the repos for my bots are linked below.
